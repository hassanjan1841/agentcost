### 10:00 AM - Hacker News

**Title:** "Show HN: AgentCost – Open-source cost tracking for AI APIs"

**First Comment:**
```
Hi HN! I built AgentCost after accidentally spending $400 on Claude API in one weekend.

The problem: AI costs are invisible until the bill arrives. Most developers have no idea what they're spending.

AgentCost gives you:
- Real-time cost tracking
- Budget alerts (email when you hit 80%)
- Zero code changes (SDK wrapper)
- Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google

It's open source (MIT) and self-hostable.

Tech: Next.js 15, Vercel Postgres, TypeScript

Would love your feedback! What features would make this more useful?
